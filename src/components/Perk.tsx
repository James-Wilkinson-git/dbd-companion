        <p>Lady Luck always seems to be throwing something good your way.</p>

        <p>
          When retrieving an Item from a Chest, there is a chance an Add-on will
          be attached to it.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>100 % chance for an Add-on of Very Rare Rarity or lower.</li>
          <li>
            10/25/50 % chance for a second Add-on of Uncommon Rarity or lower.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ace in the Hole allows you to keep any Add-ons your Item has
            equipped upon escaping.
          </li>
        </ul>
